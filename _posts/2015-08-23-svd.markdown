In this post, I will describe some tips on SVD from a programmer point of view.

SVD is actually one of the most important and frequently invlolved technique in graphics and animation, as it is the way to compute the transformation between correspondences. To name just a few, we were curious as being reading papers regarding motion capture facial animation, as-rigid-as-possible surface modeling, registration in capturing, etc. Hope this post gives a useful guide regarding the implementation behind.


Given a set of points, in their initial configuration $$p_{i}$$ and current configuration $$p_{i}^{t}$$, the goal is to find the transformation $$[R, T]$$ such that the least suqares error is minimized:

$$ \sum \parallel p_{i}^{t}-(R_{t}p_{i}+T_{t})\parallel^{2} $$
