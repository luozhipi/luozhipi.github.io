I try to compile a list of the most representative survey papers on deformation, which includes the state-of-the-art techniques, used to produce visually and or physically plausible deformations in computer animation.

In the context of animation, the critical criteria of deformation are stablity, speed, precision, and controllablity. In this post, several nice survey papers are outlined.

`direct smooth skinning` by Ladislav Kavan:

[Direct Skinning Methods and Deformation Primitives]

`variational deformation` by Mario Botsch & Olga Sorkine:

[On Linear Variational Surface Deformation Methods]

`physically-based deformable models` by Andrew Nealen et al.:

[Physically Based Deformable Models in Computer Graphics]

[Direct Skinning Methods and Deformation Primitives]:  /papers/skinning.pdf

[On Linear Variational Surface Deformation Methods]: /papers/variational.pdf
