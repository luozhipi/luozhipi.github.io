 voxel (may called brick, cube) is the next representation of the virtual worlds, in films, animation, and or games.
 
 I have been keen on voxels since last year. This time there is a sudden chance, pushing me again think deeply about that, and recall something that I would like to collect here.
 I believe you will love voxels if you see `Minecraft` and `The Lego Movie`.

  `open source voxelisation`:
  
 [PolyVox]
 
 `SVO and rendering`:
 [Efficient Sparse Voxel Octrees]
 
 [Voxel-Based Global Illumination]
 
 [GigaVoxels: A Voxel-Based Rendering Pipeline For Efficient Exploration Of Large And Detailed Scenes]
 
There is another very interesting paper I have read. It is about how to insert joints between voxels, so then can (dis)assemble Lego like body.
[Boxelization: Folding 3D Objects into Boxes]

For R&D, then it is neccesary to know `Constructive Solid Geometry`, and surfcing by maching cube or [Dual Contouring]
