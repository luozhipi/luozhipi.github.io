javascript is powerful, and it seems that this language will dominate the furture. To boost the world, everyone could programming, that is the idea. So now cloud-based IDE, scalble system architecture (e.g. `Node.js`), etc., all are out of javascript.

As a 3D guy, I just start scrtipting of course based on `three.js`, the webGL javascript. By Forking a github project, my first three.js project [bvh_viewer] is on the way, it is about animation, specifically viewing bvh files.
