Recently, I came across siggraph papers, and found the "3D photography" prototype. Since I have worked on 3D for mobiles at a company, where though we 
developed 3D reconstruction via front rgb-d or dual camera, we have the limitations of seeking promising applications.

What are the bunus points of 3D for flagship mobiles? This is a challenging, confusing, trouble, to many China mobile brands, including Huawei, OPPO, VIVO, XIAOMI.
My involved experience, as well as I have talked to people in OPPO etc, they all have those troubles. As a result, they are doubling why should spend a lot of efforts and money
to develop 3D camera and capturing algorithms. This is mainly because China brands just follow Apple, but truely don't know the Apple's secret.

"3D photography" in person I think it is a good chioce for China brands to advance their 3D research and development. That technique captures a set of 
photos, and genertes depth, color to reconstruct a shell-like 3D mesh/geometry. Based on the geometry, many 3D effects could be enhanced, like the virtual-real
fusuin as a main AR feature.

check out papers "Casual 3D Photography" at Siggraph 2017, and improved version as "Instant 3D Photography" at Siggraph 2018. BTW kohannes Kopf is a cool, talent researcher in this area.
